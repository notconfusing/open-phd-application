A PhD at iSchool is the consequent of my academic preparation and work experience. Although it was never intentional, the trajectory from my job as research assistant at OCLC Research think tank, to the paper-fruiting Open Source / Open Science collaborations with PhDs world-wide has drawn an arrow to your department. Let us inspect this space reverse chronologically, starting from the future. In spring 2015, I will present the research "The Virtous Circle of Wikipedia", at Computer-Supported Collaborative Work conference 2015. Despite my first-authorship, the project was a collaboration with iSchool PhD Thomas Maillart, who pushed me to learn methodogoly and read literature the best way possible - implicitly expecting my knowledge or competence to work hard enough to have it by Monday. (What skills did I actually learn. Network Science (talk about poster) and stastics)

I had come to meet Thomas at the Berekeley Institute for Data Science launch event, where I was manning the Wikipedia Research booth in volunteer capacity. The Wikipedia Research network has been close albeit informal home for me (in that way that only mainly-online relationships can be). There I have contributed the Wikipedia Research Newsletter writing monthly since December 2013 (weak claim?). That is where my blog posts on a series "afternoon
hacks" on the Gender Biases in different Wikipedia languages was picked up by Hanyang University Sociology PhD Piotr Konieczny. We came to work together on creating "Wikipedia Gender Inequality Index" (WIGI). I created the infrastructure to automatically mine Wikidata and create Open Datasets, together we analysed the results by Date and Place of Birth, Ethnicity, Citizenship, and Language. Piotr provided Socilogical Explanations.

The way I came to be involved WikiResearch was as coworker-augmenterst at my job as "Research Assisant, Wikipedian in Residence" at OCLC, where my biggest problem was how to spend the blue-sky freedom I received. This is where I cut my programming and big-data teeth on OCLC's big library datasets, stack overflow, open source mailing lists, and being left to my own devices at cubicle for 2 years. Ultimately I enriched Wikipedia with data taken from the Library of Congress and other national libraries to the tune of 2 million edits, making my software the 50th most prolific editor on Wikipedia yet. I published about this too.

OCLC hired me because of my mathematical inclination cocktail-party-converation-ending generalist geek interests. Those traits are easily traceable to my Pure Mathematics Bachelors education at UC Berkeley.

All in all, it's story of focusing and triangulating from logical abstraction, to technical social theory. I've not chosen iSchool as a location that might be good for me, but rather found myself arrived there after having constantly refined and followed my natural inclinations. It's also incontrovertible that this path is definitely my default Otaku as all my work has been accomplished through the ample freedom I've been given, and have taken for myself. My last instructions from a boss were 3 years ago, when OCLC told me to impress them with research, from there it was a snowball of self-starting. After finding an online community, I had a blog of curious enough research to attract academic collaborators, and then I took time off to pursue those ends - the result of which is that I started researching and publishing in a way that is very similar to what I imagine I would do if I were in the program I am applying to today.


# Future directions.
+ Not caring about financial motivations.

+ Professorship

  + Continue research on how social work effects social biases in general. I want to hold a mirror up to the internet, so we can see ourselves.
  + I do think that teaching is important (for instance I've done it at sudo).

Let us imagine a future in which everything goes according to plan, the ceremony has occured, and I'm a PhD. What next? A career professorship may be in order. It's instructive to think about my relationship to hackerspaces. With a group of friends I start the hackerspace Sudo Room, to work in myself, because money has never driven me and social uplift always has. Although career hackerdom relies on self-drive to an extreme (since co-hackers are varyingly serious), career academia does not since colleagues are more uniformly serious. Still the hackerspace an university paradigm share the relatively sheltered position to work and teach about technology and society mostly freely, as long as you can accept some material austerity - both of which is an part of my personality.
